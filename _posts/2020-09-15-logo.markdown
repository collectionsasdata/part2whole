Are you interested in working with collections as data? While supply lasts, you can make a request for a hex laptop sticker to be mailed to you, at no cost, [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSXHv0fKXKghr0WOInoIQI_qdTRao0JPsNy56jo45qUJvaYw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  

The logo has an owl, a book, and multicolored abstraction of data - what more could there be? Increasingly diverse global efforts in this space are tough to represent visually but we hope we landed on something that resonates.   

All logo design files are included [here](https://github.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/raw/master/collectionsasdata_logo.zip).
