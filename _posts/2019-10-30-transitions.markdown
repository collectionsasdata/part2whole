**Laurie Allen** recently joined the awesome LC Labs team at the Library of Congress. In her new role, Laurie will help lead [**Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud (CCHC)**](https://labs.loc.gov/experiments/cchc/). In order to focus on CCHC, Laurie has transitioned away from Collections as Data: Part to Whole. We are excited to see the good work she gets up to at the Library of Congress and look forward to the ways in which she pushes the boundaries of collections as data oriented work. 

Departures are always tough, but they also create opportunities. The Part to Whole team was unanimous about who we wanted to join us next and luckily that person accepted! We are pleased to announce that **Yasmeen Shorish**, Associate Professor at James Madison University Libraries, has officially joined the Collections as Data: Part to Whole team. 

Yasmeen brings a new, exciting perspective to the project. Yasmeen has a wealth of experience in research data management, scholarly communications, and efforts that work to advocate for disenfranchised populations. Yasmeen was Co-PI on [**Supporting OA Collections in the Open**](https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/OA-forum/), co-founded the Digital Library Federation’s [**Technologies of Surveillance**](https://wiki.diglib.org/Technologies_of_Surveillance) working group, and served as past chair of ACRL’s Research and Scholarly Environment Committee (ReSEC) wherein she stewarded the development and publication of [**Open and Equitable Scholarly Communications: Creating a More Inclusive Future**](https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2019/06/20/acrl-research-agenda-more-inclusive-future/). We are so excited about Yasmeen joining the team and believe that she will be a tremendous asset to the work that lies before us. 

Please join us in a hearty congratulations to Laurie, and the warmest welcome to Yasmeen!
