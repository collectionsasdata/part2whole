## in-person

From April 25-26 practitioners and disciplinary researchers will gather in Vancouver, Canada at Internet Archive Canada for **Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions** to assess the state of the field on an international level - challenges, aspirations, and prospective ways of working together. This work will produce position statements, a white paper, an update to the Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data, and if all goes well, subsequent, collaborative collections as data efforts.
