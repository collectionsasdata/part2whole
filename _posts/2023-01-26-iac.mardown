**Collections as Data: Part to Whole** and the pre-cursor effort **Always Already Computational: Collections as Data** are committed to including as many perspectives as possible in the development of collections as data community. Accordingly, we aim to foster multiple paths to participation in Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions.  

## In-person

From April 25-26 practitioners and disciplinary researchers will gather in Vancouver, Canada for **Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions** to assess the state of the field on an international level - challenges, aspirations, and prospective ways of working together. This work will produce position statements, a white paper, and if all goes well, subsequent, collaborative collections as data efforts.

## Asynchronous 

Following the in-person event, from May to June 2023, we will release a draft version of the white paper resulting from **Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions**. We will also release a CFP intended to garner additional position statements focused on informing future directions of collections as data work.
