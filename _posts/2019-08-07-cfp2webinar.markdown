The Collections as Data: Part to Whole [**cohort 2 CFP**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/cfp/) is now open! The CFP will close on October 31. During this round $300,000 will be awarded to six teams. With CLIR's support, we are offering two webinars to support potential cohort 2 applicants.  

On **August 5** we will offer an [**overview of the project and the CFP, followed by Q&A**](https://clirdlf.zoom.us/webinar/register/beb5b14bf554b4594ac87b605f06faf5). 

On **August 19** we will have an [**open Q&A period**](). 

In advance of the webinars we recommend reviewing the [Part to Whole grant narrative](https://github.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/raw/master/cad_part2whole_narrative.pdf). We look forward to working with you and welcome any questions that you might have as you consider putting a proposal forward.
