*Collections as Data: Part to Whole* Cohort 2 projects are complete and all [**deliverables**](https://osf.io/r9n3s/wiki/home/) are now available. Cohort 2 spans Louisiana State University, University of Arizona, Harvard University, University of Richmond, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, Claremont Colleges, Florida International University, and the University of Florida. Final reports present lessons learned and links to documentation, data, code, and more. 

Combined with the six teams that came before them, it our hope that the [**collective work**](https://osf.io/r9n3s/wiki/home/) articulates a range of approaches that support collections as data implementation *and* use. We believe that the viability of collections as data work depends on the development of approaches that map to diverse institutional contexts, resource assumptions, and community commitments. There is no singular collections as data model and we feel that cultivating diversity in approach continues to show promise. 

Our deepest thanks to cohort 2!
