Today we are excited to share the [**Collections as Data: Part to Whole Final Report**](https://zenodo.org/records/10161976). The report represents 5 years of work to responsible development and computational use of memory organization collections as data. The focus on sustaining potential while mitigating harm throughout this effort becomes all the more salient in the present moment as memory organizations seek to navigate  challenges and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence. Any success of Collections as Data: Part to Whole should be attributed to the generosity and creativity of our many partners throughout the [**United States**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/cohortone/) and [**around the world**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/recap/). Maintaining curiosity, empathy, and care for colleagues across a global pandemic is no small feat and we are deeply thankful to you all. 

Given the growth of international collections-as-data effort, we have had the final report professionally translated into [**French**](https://zenodo.org/records/10211287), [**Spanish**](https://zenodo.org/records/10211449), and [**Arabic**](https://zenodo.org/records/10211463) (in addition to the previously released [**Vancouver Statement on Collections-as-Data**](https://zenodo.org/records/8342171) with a forthcoming Dutch translation from Saskia Scheltjens of the Rijksmuseum and Steven Claeysens of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek as well as a Spanish translation of the international summit [**participant position statements**](https://zenodo.org/records/7897735)). 

The Collections as Data: Part to Whole project team is actively seeking partners that can resource and share the responsibility for further collections-as-data community growth and impact on a global level. Preliminary conversations have been had with potential partners in the European Union, the United States, and Argentina. If your organization or community is interested in partnering on  collections-as-data community development as described above, please reach out to the Collections as Data: Part to Whole project team. On a similar note, if there is a way the project team can support your collections-as-data community effort, please reach out.
