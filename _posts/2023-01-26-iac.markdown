## in-person participation

From April 25-26 practitioners and disciplinary researchers will gather in Vancouver, Canada for **Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions** to assess the state of the field on an international level - challenges, aspirations, and prospective ways of working together. This work will produce position statements, a white paper, and if all goes well, subsequent, collaborative collections as data efforts.
