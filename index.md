**Collections as Data: Part to Whole** aims to foster development of a community that will craft broadly viable models that guide approaches to implementing and supporting the use of [collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/). This effort is generously supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation ([**see grant narrative**](https://github.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/raw/master/cad_part2whole_narrative.pdf)). 

Over a period of three years *Collections as Data: Part to Whole* will fund 12 teams across two cohorts. Cohorts will be comprised of project teams jointly led by librarians and disciplinary scholars. Project teams will develop models that support collections as data implementation and holistic reconceptualization of services and roles that support scholarly use. Collections as data produced by project activity will exhibit high research value, demonstrate the capacity to serve underrepresented communities, represent a diversity of content types, languages, and descriptive practices, and arise from a range of institutional contexts. 

Cohort 1 Call for Proposals can be found [**here**]().
