**Collections as Data: Part to Whole** aimed to foster responsible implementation *and* use of [**collections as data**](https://zenodo.org/records/8342171). This effort was made possible by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation ([**see grant narrative**](https://github.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/raw/master/cad_part2whole_narrative.pdf)). 

Collections as Data: Part to Whole was preceded by [**Always Already Computational: Collections as Data**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/). This effort was made possible by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
