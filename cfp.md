- **Submission Deadline: October 31, 2019** 
- Project Initiation: January 2020
- Project Completion: April 2021


*Collections as Data: Part to Whole* is pleased to share the cohort 2 call for proposals! Weâ€™ll award **$300,000** to six teams in this round and look forward to working with you.  We welcome any questions that you might have as you consider putting a proposal forward. Though we continue to support the development of collections as data focused on text data and their metadata, we are especially looking forward to proposals that engage with various types of objects such as 3-dimensional artifacts, audio and visual materials, and born digital. Languages represented in collections other than English are also encouraged. Feel free to contact us directly or using [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUpy6FxMSxpM814v03-uscvoFs6yhHASq9z3SVpNdkkqYA0w/viewform?usp=sf_link) with questions.

### A bit of background

Increasingly, cultural heritage organizations dedicate effort to ethically grounded creation of machine actionable collections. The concept of [collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/) is frequently used to align efforts in this space. In 2016, [*Always Already Computational: Collections as Data*](https://osf.io/mx6uk/wiki/home/) began documenting, iterating on, and sharing current and potential approaches to developing and supporting the use of machine actionable cultural heritage collections. **Always Already Computational found that cultural heritage professionals desired opportunities to shift work in this space from an emergent to core organizational activity.** 

*Collections as Data: Part to Whole* was formed to help spark this shift. 

### What weâ€™re looking for 

*Collections as Data: Part to Whole* ([see grant narrative](https://github.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/raw/master/cad_part2whole_narrative.pdf)) fosters the development of models that **(1)** support computational use of collections as data **(2)** and models that support collections as data creation. With generous support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, *Part to Whole* is funding and programmatically supporting two collections as data cohorts. We seek proposals from teams jointly led by a librarian, archivist, or museum professional with senior administrative responsibilities, a disciplinary scholar, and a project lead. 

Teams apply for **$50,000** to support the development of a use model, an implementation model,  and a new collection as data.     

- **Use model** - should describe the positions, specific duties, services, and collaborations that will support computational use of collections as data by specific communities. Addresses how all of the above will be sustained post funding.

- **Implementation model** - should describe the workflows, infrastructure, code, positions, specific duties, and services that make it possible to create and provide access to collections as data. Addresses how all of the above will be sustained post funding.

- **Collection as data** - exhibit high research value, demonstrate the capacity to serve underrepresented communities, represents a diversity of content types (text, images, audio, video, metadata, etc.), languages, and descriptive practices, and arises from a range of institutional contexts (R1, liberal arts college, community college, etc.). Your collection need not exhibit all content types listed.

Competitive proposals will evidence commitment to creative and sustainable collaborations across an organization that support computational use of collections as data. As you develop your proposal, we encourage you to think about the kinds of collaborations youâ€™ve been wanting to have with colleagues across your organization. Use this opportunity to bridge silos in unexpected ways. Plan for those bridges to be sustained. There is a place in this work for people throughout an organization, including but not limited to liaisonship, teaching and learning, repository development, digital collections, digital scholarship, archives, scholarly communication and more. Proposals are further strengthened by their ability to evidence how project team members will be administratively supported throughout their project and how the project will continue to be supported, and potentially expanded, after the funded project is complete.

### What youâ€™ll receive if funded   

**$50,000** to support the development of a use model, an implementation model, and a new collection as data.  

Funding may be used for the following activities:
* Buying out staff and/or faculty time
* Fees associated with team training
* Room rental and catering for meetings
* Conference travel to present on the project
* Consultants from outside the institution   

Funded teams join a cohort of 6 and are programmatically supported by a two-day Team Lead Institute where team leaders will be invited to learn from others and strengthen their work. The Team Lead Institute will be facilitated by two invited experts and the Part to Whole project team. Project leads will also join the rest of the cohort at a public Summative Forum towards the end of the project to present the models, collection, and invite feedback from a broader audience. Funded teams will also have opportunities to seek feedback from the [Part to Whole Advisory Board](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/team/). 

### Some guidelines 

Per [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/inquiries-and-guidelines/), indirect costs cannot be funded.

We discourage proposals that ask for funds for contingent or temporary labor. Student labor may be funded through the project as long as the students are fairly paid, and all participants are credited in project materials. Funds may not be used to pay for digitization or hardware. 


### Evaluation Criteria

1. Use model demonstrates: 
- Innovative, cross-division and/or cross-departmental formation of positions and services that support the use of collections as data
- Local sustainability
- Ready potential for adaptability by other institutions

2. Implementation model demonstrates:
- Innovative, cross-division and/or cross-departmental formation of positions and services needed to implement collections as data
- Local sustainability
- Ready potential for adaptability by other institutions

3. Proposed collections as data evidence:
- significant research value
- the perspectives of underrepresented and/or oppressed groups 

4. The proposed project demonstrates commitment to developing and implementing processes for addressing complex ethical issues inherent to engagement with cultural heritage data, and the needs of marginalized and underrepresented communities.

5. The proposed project evidences knowledge of complementary collections, standards, and initiatives in the library field and scholarly disciplines that speak to project goals.

6. The proposed project utilizes open source technologies that aim for interoperability (where appropriate) with a broader open scholarly communication infrastructure.

Strong proposals will further evidence how project team members will be administratively supported throughout the project and how the project will continue to be supported, and potentially expanded, after the funded project is complete.

### A requirement 

Project leads for each project will participate in the Team Lead Institute and Summative Forum. The cost of attendance for the three team leads will be covered by Part to Whole and need not be budgeted in project proposals.

### Who can apply 

The applicant institution must be located in the United States or in an associated entity, e.g., the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or American Samoa.

### Submissions

Proposals should follow this format and be submitted [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePQ5osAJLzqWEZZys7LpdPn3C5KiSzxbSfhBuoF1_-iztVQA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
