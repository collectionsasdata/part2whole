**Cohort 1 Deadline: October 31, 2018**
Cohort 2 Deadline: October 31, 2019 

### Context

A growing number of cultural heritage organizations have invested in the creation of collections that are amenable to computational use. Increasingly, the concept of [**collections as data**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/) is used to align efforts of this kind. In 2016, [**Always Already Computational: Collections as Data**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/), supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, began developing the idea that digital collections could be more than digital surrogates of physical items and born digital objects; that digital collections could and should be offered as machine actionable data that are ready for computational research methods. Always Already Computational: Collections as Data demonstrated that librarians, archivists, and museum professionals readily understood the value of this work and were eager to expand the potential use of their collections. While interest is broad, the project found that cultural heritage professionals desired opportunities to further develop approaches to integrating and sustaining collections as data implementation and use as a core organizational activity. Collections as Data: Part to Whole aims to meet this challenge by supporting the development of broadly viable models that support implementation and use of collections as data ([**see grant narrative**](https://github.com/collectionsasdata/part2whole/raw/master/cad_part2whole_narrative.pdf)).

### Opportunity

With support from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation, we will fund 12 teams. 6 teams will be funded in cohort 1. Each team can apply for **$30,000 - $80,000**. To ensure that project results will be valuable to scholars and sustainable within libraries, we are seeking proposals from collaborative teams jointly led by a librarian with senior administrative responsibilities, a disciplinary scholar, and a project lead.  

*Throughout the proposal process, we encourage you to send questions to the project team. Question can be sent using this [**form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUpy6FxMSxpM814v03-uscvoFs6yhHASq9z3SVpNdkkqYA0w/viewform?usp=sf_link). We will respond promptly and schedule conversations with the project team and/or advisory board members.* 

Given the challenge of this type of work, funded teams will become part of a cohort and will be supported through a two-day Team Lead Institute where the team leaders, mentioned above, will be invited to learn from others and strengthen their work plans. To ensure that the work of funded teams can be a model for new scholars and institutions in undertaking similar projects, team leads will also present their work at a public facing summative forum at a later date. All three project leads for each project will be expected to participate in the Team Lead Institute and Summative Forum. The cost of attendance for each of the participants will be covered by the grant and need not be budgeted in project proposals.

### Evaluation Criteria

* The proposed project (especially in the draft collections as data service plan and the draft implementation plan) will demonstrate:
 - innovative organizational thinking as it applies to the roles and services needed to support the use of collections as data 
 - local sustainability 
 - evidence of ready potential for adaptability by other institutions
